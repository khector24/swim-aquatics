Dear AWS Support Team,

I am requesting to move my Amazon SES account to production mode. Below are the details of my use case:

Purpose of Emails:

My application manages subscriptions for a swimming organization called Splash Zone Aquatics. It sends welcome and unsubscribe confirmation emails based on user actions in DynamoDB.
Email Types:

Transactional emails (welcome and unsubscribe notifications).
Sending Practices:

Emails include clear sender identification (kennyhector24@gmail.com).
A functional unsubscribe link is added to every email.
Example link: https://yourdomain.com/unsubscribe?email={user_email}.
Code Overview:

Emails are triggered by DynamoDB Stream events for new subscriptions and status changes.
Code uses AWS SDK for DynamoDB and SES to manage subscription status and send emails.
Comprehensive validation ensures only valid data is processed.
Volume:

Initial expected volume is ~100 emails/day, scaling up based on user engagement.
Compliance:

Anti-spam best practices are followed, including immediate processing of unsubscribe requests and monitoring bounce rates.
Domain Verification:

Domain for sending emails is verified, and DKIM/SPF records are properly configured.
Attachments:
If needed, I can provide sample email content and code snippets for review.

Please let me know if any additional information is required. I appreciate your assistance in enabling production access for Amazon SES.

Best regards,
Kenny Hector
